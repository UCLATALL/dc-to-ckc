## 2.3 Measurement

Measurement is the process of turning variation in the world into data. When we measure, we assign numbers or category labels to some sample of cases in order to represent some attribute or dimension along which the cases vary. 

Let’s make this more concrete by looking at some more measurements, in a data set called **Fingers**. A sample of college students filled in an online survey in which they were asked a variety of basic demographic questions. They also were asked to measure the length of each finger on their right hand.

You’ll notice that trying to look at the whole data frame can be very cumbersome, especially for larger data sets.

The command ```head()``` shows you the first six rows of a data frame, but if you wanted to look at a different number of rows, you can just add in a number at the end like this.

Notice that to answer these questions, you need to know something about how these numbers were *measured*. You need to know: Was **Height** measured with inches? What number represents which **Sex**? Does **FamilyMembers** include the person answering the question? (**Sex** can be a controversial variable; see <a href="https://support.coursekata.org/portal/en/kb/articles/statement-on-sex-and-gender" target="_blank">here</a> for more on this.)

We will be talking a lot about what measurements mean throughout the class. But before we go on, let's learn one more way to take a quick look at a data frame.

### Levels of Measurement: Quantitative and Categorical Variables

Measures can be divided into two types, often referred to as "levels of measurement": *quantitative* and *categorical*. 

**FamilyMembers** and **Height** (which in this case was measured in inches) are examples of *quantitative variables*. The values assigned to quantitative variables represent some quantity (e.g., inches for height). And we can know that someone with a higher number (say, 62) is taller than someone with a lower number (say, 60). Moreover, the difference between the numbers actually tells us exactly how much taller one person is than another.

*Categorical variables* are quite different. **Sex** in this data set is a categorical variable. Students categorized themselves as male, female, or other. For purposes of analysis we might code each person in the following way: 1 if they are female; 2 if male; or 3 if other. The specific numbers we assign are arbitrary; we could have said other is 1, female is 2, and male is 3. The numbers don’t tell us anything about quantity; the numbers simply tell us which category the object belongs to.

While we use the terms quantitative and categorical, other writers will use other terms. They all mean roughly the same thing so you may not want to get hung up on these particular terms. Here are a few synonyms for quantitative variable and categorical variable that you may run across:

### Quantitative and Categorical Variables in R

Quantitative variables are always represented as *numeric* (or *num*) variables in R. *Categorical* variables could be either *numeric* or *character* (*chr*) variables in R, depending on what values they hold. If we were to code the variable **Sex**, for example, as 1 or 2 (for male and female) we could put the values in a numeric variable in R. If, on the other  hand, we wanted to enter the values "male" or "female" into the variable **Sex**, R would represent it as a character variable. No matter what kind of variable we use in R, from the researcher's point of view, the variable itself is still categorical. 

R won’t necessarily know whether a variable is quantitative or categorical. A number could be used by a researcher to code a categorical variable (e.g., 1 for males and 2 for females), or it could represent units of some real quantitative measurement (1 sibling or 2 siblings). R will usually try to guess what kind of variable it is, but it may guess wrong! 

For that reason, R has a way to let you specify whether a variable is categorical, using the ```factor()``` command. A *factor* variable, in R, is always categorical. In the **Fingers** data frame, **Sex** is coded as 1 or 2. In order for R to know that it is categorical, we can tell it by using the command ```factor(Fingers$Sex)```. Remember, we also have to save the result of the command back into the **Fingers** data frame if we want R to remember it. We use the following code to turn **Sex** into a factor, and then replace the old version of the variable, which was numeric, with the new version, a factor:

```
Fingers$Sex <- factor(Fingers$Sex)
```

We can also turn a factor back into a numeric variable by using the ```as.numeric()``` function. 

If the 1s and 2s in the **Sex** column were numbers, we could add them up using the code ```sum(Fingers$Sex)```. But if we tell R that **Sex** is a factor, it will assume the 1s and 2s refer to categories, and so it won’t be willing to add them up.

Try running this code to find the sum of **Sex** when it is coded as a factor:

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch2-13" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-2/ch2-13" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p>

That didn't work! To get the sum of the **Sex** variable, you can use `as.numeric()` to convert it back to numbers before using `sum()`.

Depending on your goals, you may decide to treat a variable with numbers as both a quantitative and a categorical variable. If this is the case, it’s a good idea to make two copies of the variable, one *numeric* and one *factor*. 

For example, Likert scales (those questions that ask you to rate something on a 5- or 7-point scale) could be treated as *quantitative* variables in some situations, and *categorical* in other situations. In the **Fingers** data frame we have a variable called **Interest**, a rating by students of how interested they are in statistics. It is coded on a 3-point scale from 0 (no interest) to 2 (very interested).

If you want to ask what the average rating is, you would need the variable to be *numeric* in R. But if you want to compare the group of people who gave a 0 rating with those who gave a 2, you want R to know that you consider **Interest** to be a *factor*.  

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch2-14" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-2/ch2-14" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p>

If you made this new variable correctly, you won't see anything appear in the R console. That's because simply creating a new variable doesn't cause R to print out anything. Sometimes while you are coding, you'll feel like you did something wrong because nothing gets printed. It might just be that you didn't tell R to print anything.

The ```str()``` command tells you the type of each variable in a data frame. In the code you just wrote, you told R to make a new factor variable, **Fingers\$Interest.factor**, based on the numeric variable, **Fingers\$Interest**. If you wanted to check whether you were successful, you could type ```str(Fingers)``` in the DataCamp window you were just working in. 

The output shows that the **Fingers** data frame now includes a new variable, **Fingers$Interest.factor**, and also confirms that this new variable is a factor variable.

```
str(Fingers)
```
