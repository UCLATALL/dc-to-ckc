## 2.2 A Data Frame Example: MindsetMatters

The data we looked at on the previous page were selected from a data frame called **MindsetMatters**. The full data frame is from a study that investigated the health of 75 female housekeepers from different hotels. You can read more about how these data were collected and organized here: <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Lock5withR/versions/1.2.2/topics/MindsetMatters" target="_blank"> [MindsetMatters R documentation]</a>. 

A data frame is a kind of object in R, and as with any object, you can just type the name of it to see the whole thing. 

Type the name of the data frame **MindsetMatters** and then Run.

Be sure to scroll up on the R console to see the whole output. Once you do, you might think to yourself, "Wow, that’s a lot to take in!" This is usually the case when working with real data—there are a whole lot of things in a data set, including a lot of variables and values. And usually we don’t just sample one case (e.g., one housekeeper)—we have a bunch of housekeepers, each with their own values for a bunch of variables. So things get pretty complicated, pretty fast.

It’s always useful to take a quick peek at your data frame. But looking at the whole thing might be a little complicated. So a helpful command is ```head()``` which shows you just the first few rows of a data frame. 

Press the Run button to see what happens when you run the command ```head(MindsetMatters)```.

The ```head()``` function just prints out the first six rows of the data frame as rows and columns. 

Depending on your browser, your output might not look exactly like the one pictured above. The output might be easier to read if you adjust the vertical divider to make the console wider. However, with so many variables, they still won't all fit in one row. When the row numbers start again, the output continues with the columns that didn’t fit. Your output might look more like this:

```

   Condition

2 Uninformed
3 Uninformed
4 Uninformed
5 Uninformed
6 Uninformed
```

In the output (pictured above), **Condition** didn’t fit in on the same row. Let’s try to read the data for the first housekeeper (in row 1). Her age (**Age**) was 43, starting weight (**Wt**) was 137 pounds, starting BMI (**BMI**) was 25.1, and BMI at the end of the study (**BMI2**) was 25.1. She was also in the uninformed condition. 

Sometimes, it’s useful just to get an overview of what’s in the data frame. The function ```str()``` shows us the overall structure of the data frame, including number of observations, number of variables, names of variables and so on. (We often use ```str()``` when first exploring a new data frame, just to see what's in it.)

Run ```str()``` on **MindsetMatters** and look at the results.

Note that there is a ```$``` in front of each variable name. In R, ```$``` is often used to indicate that what follows is a variable name. If you want to specify the **Age** variable in the **MindsetMatters** data frame, for example, you would write ```MindsetMatters$Age```. (R has its own way of categorizing variables, such as int, num, and Factor. You will learn more about these later.)

Try using the ```$``` to print out just the variable **Age** from **MindsetMatters**.

When R is asked to print out a single variable (such as **Age**), R prints out each person’s value on the variable all in a row. When it gets to the end of one row it begins again on the next row. In contrast, when R is asked to print out multiple variables, it uses the rows and columns format, where rows are cases and columns are variables. 

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch2_Measurement_7_v2"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch2_Measurement_7_v2" width="100%" height="250"></iframe>

If you counted the ages printed on the first row, there are 25 of them. The `[26]` indicates that the next row starts with the 26th observation.

Let's use the ```tally()``` function to create a frequency table of the **Age** variable (in the **MindsetMatters** data frame). This will tell us how many housekeepers there were of each age.

```
tally(MindsetMatters$Age)
```

We don't have to use the ```$``` notation. We could also specify the variable and data frame separately, like this:

```
tally(~ Age, data = MindsetMatters)
``` 

```
Age
  19   21   22   23   24   26   27   28   29   30   31   32   33   34   35   37

  57   58   61   62   65 <NA> 
   1    1    1    1    1    1
```

The rows that start with 19, 38, and 57 represent the ages of the housekeepers and the numbers underneath them represent how many of each age are in the data frame. For example, there is one housekeeper who is 19 years old. There are two housekeepers who are 54 years old. There are three housekeepers who are 45 years old. 

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch2_FromNumbers_5a"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch2_FromNumbers_5a" width="100%" height="150"></iframe>

Try using the tally function to make a frequency table of housekeepers by **Condition**.  

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch2-6" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-2/ch2-6" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p> 

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch2_FromNumbers_6a"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch2_FromNumbers_6a" width="100%" height="200"></iframe>
 
<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch2_FromNumbers_6c"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch2_FromNumbers_6c" width="100%" height="150"></iframe>

The output of `tally()` shows us that there are 41 housekeepers who were in the Informed condition and 34 in the Uninformed condition. Taking a look at this frequency table, we might wonder why there were slightly more housekeepers who were informed that their daily work of cleaning was equivalent to getting adequate exercise.

Let’s turn our attention to two variables in the **MindsetMatters** data frame: **Age** (the age of the housekeepers, in years, at the start of the study) and **Wt** (their weight, in pounds, at the start of the study). 

We might want to sort the whole data frame **MindsetMatters** by **Age**. But now we can’t use the ```sort()``` function—that only works with vectors, not with data frames. So, if you want to sort a whole data frame, we will use a different function, ```arrange()```.

The ```arrange()``` function works similarly to ```sort()```, except now you have to specify both the name of the data frame, and the name of the variable on which you want to sort.

```
arrange(MindsetMatters, Age)
``` 

And, importantly, when you sort on one variable (e.g., **Age**), the order of the rows (which in this case is housekeepers) will change for every variable.  

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch2_FromNumbers_8"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch2_FromNumbers_8" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>

The printout of **MindsetMatters** won’t stay arranged by age because we didn’t save our work. In order to save the new ordering, we need to assign the arranged version to an R object. We could assign it to a new object (e.g., **Mindset2**, **MM2**, or any other name you want to make up), or we could just assign it to the existing object (**MindsetMatters**). If we assign it to the existing object it will revise what's in **MindsetMatters** to be in the new order. 

Let’s use the assignment operator (```<-```) to assign it back to **MindsetMatters**. See if you can edit the code below to save the version of **MindsetMatters** which is arranged by **Age** back into **MindsetMatters**. Then print out the first six lines of **MindsetMatters** using ```head()```.

The function ```arrange()``` can also be used to arrange values in descending order by adding ```desc()``` around our variable name.

```
arrange(MindsetMatters, desc(Age))
```

Try arranging **MindsetMatters** by **Wt** in descending order. Save this to **MindsetMatters**. Print a few rows of **MindsetMatters** to check out what happened.
