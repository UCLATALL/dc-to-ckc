## 7.9 Extending to a Three-Group Model

You have now learned how to specify a model with a single categorical explanatory variable consisting of two groups. It’s actually pretty simple to extend this idea to a categorical variable with three groups. 

### First, a New Two-Group Model

Let’s use a new explanatory variable to explain variation in thumb length: ```Height```. ```Height```, in our data set, is a quantitative variable measured in inches. But we can make a new variable that turns ```Height``` into a categorical variable with two categories: ```short``` and ```tall```. 

We can do this easily in R. We will use the ```ntile()``` function to cut the sample up into two equal-sized groups based on ```Height``` and save the result into a new variable called ```Height2Group```. 

```
Fingers$Height2Group <- ntile(Fingers$Height, 2)
head(select(Fingers, Thumb, Height, Height2Group), 10)
``` 

We will then use ```head()``` and ```select()``` to look at the first 10 rows of the relevant variables – ```Thumb```, ```Height```, and ```Height2Group```:  

```
   Thumb Height Height2Group
1  66.00   70.5            2
2  64.00   64.8            1
3  56.00   64.0            1
4  58.42   70.0            2
5  74.00   68.0            2
6  60.00   68.0            2
7  70.00   69.0            2
8  55.00   65.7            2
9  60.00   62.5            1
10 52.00   63.4            1
```

In the code window below, use the ```factor()``` function to add labels to ```Height2Group``` so that the 1s are labeled as ```short``` and the 2s are labeled as ```tall```. Just a reminder: Use the larger data frame, ```Fingers```. 

 <p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch7-16" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-7/ch7-16.html" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p> 

```
   Thumb Height Height2Group
1  66.00   70.5         tall
2  64.00   64.8        short
3  56.00   64.0        short
4  58.42   70.0         tall
5  74.00   68.0         tall
6  60.00   68.0         tall
7  70.00   69.0         tall
8  55.00   65.7         tall
9  60.00   62.5        short
10 52.00   63.4        short 
```

Using the same approach we used for sex, we can write the model for ```Height2Group``` like this:

$$Y_{i}=b_{0}+b_{1}X_{i}+e_{i}$$ 

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch7_Extending_1"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch7_Extending_1" width="100%" height="400"></iframe>

Go ahead and fit the ```Height2Group``` model and take a look at the parameter estimates.  

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch7-17" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-7/ch7-17.html" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p> 

```
Call:
lm(formula = Thumb ~ Height2Group, data = Fingers)

Coefficients:
     (Intercept)  Height2Grouptall  
          57.818             4.601
```

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch7_Extending_2"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch7_Extending_2" width="100%" height="1100"></iframe> 

Now go ahead and run ```supernova()``` to print the complete ANOVA table for the ```Height2Group.model```. 

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch7-18" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-7/ch7-18.html" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p> 

```

Let’s now compare the ```Sex``` model with the ```Height2Group``` model. Both of these are two-group models, and both have the same outcome variable (```Thumb```). What differs is the explanatory variable (```Sex``` vs. ```Height2Group```). We’ve pasted in the supernova table for both models below:

### A Three-Group Model

Now let’s try this same approach with three height groups: short, medium, and tall.

Revise the code below to make a new variable called ```Height3Group``` that divides the sample into three categories based on ```Height```, each with an equal number of students. Label the levels (1,2,3) as ```short```, ```medium```, and ```tall```.  

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch7-19" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-7/ch7-19.html" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p> 

```
   Thumb Height Height3Group
1  66.00   70.5         tall
2  64.00   64.8       medium
3  56.00   64.0        short
4  58.42   70.0         tall
5  74.00   68.0         tall
6  60.00   68.0         tall
7  70.00   69.0         tall
8  55.00   65.7       medium
9  60.00   62.5        short
10 52.00   63.4        short 
```

Calculate and print out the group means of ```Thumb``` for the three height groups.  

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch7-20" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-7/ch7-20.html" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p> 

```
  Height3Group   min    Q1 median    Q3   max     mean       sd  n missing

3         tall 44.45 59.75     64 68.25 90.00 64.09365 8.388113 52       0 
```

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch7_Extending_5"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch7_Extending_5" width="100%" height="400"></iframe>

#### Fitting the Height3Group Model

Now use the code window below to fit the ```Height3Group``` model to the data, and print out the model estimates.  

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch7-21" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-7/ch7-21.html" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p> 

```
Call:
lm(formula = Thumb ~ Height3Group, data = Fingers)

Coefficients:
       (Intercept)  Height3Groupmedium    Height3Grouptall  
            56.071               4.153               8.023 
```

The three-group model is written like this using General Linear Model notation: 

$$Y_{i}=b_{0}+b_{1}X_{1i}+b_{2}X_{2i}+e_{i}$$

Whereas fitting the two-group model involved constructing two parameter estimates ($$b_{0}$$ and $$b_{1}$$), the three-group model adds a third parameter estimate ($$b_{2}$$). 

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch7_Extending_6"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch7_Extending_6" width="100%" height="950"></iframe>

#### Interpreting the Height3Group Model

$$b_{0}$$ is the mean of the short group. $$b_{1}$$ is the increment you have to add to the short group to get the mean of the medium group. And $$b_{2}$$ is the increment you have to add to the short group to get the mean of the tall group.

We can substitute in the parameter estimates into the model, like this:

$$Y_{i}=56.07+4.15X_{1i}+8.02X_{2i}+e_{i}$$

Just as before, it is useful to think through exactly how the X variables are coded. Notice, first, that we now have two of these in the model: $$X_{1i}$$ and $$X_{2i}$$. The new subscripts (1 and 2) just distinguish between the two variables; instead of giving them different names, we call them X-sub-1 and X-sub-2.  

The sub-i indicates these are not parameters, but variables, which means that each individual in the data set will have their own scores on the two variables. As before, it’s a little tricky to figure out what all the possible scores are on these two variables, and also how scores are assigned for each individual. 

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch7_Extending_7"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch7_Extending_7" width="100%" height="420"></iframe>

R doesn’t necessarily use the same numbers you do to code a variable. For the ```Height3Group``` model we put in a single categorical explanatory variable (```Height3Group```, with level 1 representing short, 2 representing medium, and 3 representing tall). But R turns this one variable into two new variables, $$X_{1}$$ and $$X_{2}$$, both of which are *dummy coded*, which means they can either have a value of 0 or 1 for each person in the data set.

Here's how dummy coding works: For someone in the short group, the model needs to assign them a score of 56.07, the mean for the short group. You can think of $$X_{1}$$ as a variable asking, "Is this person medium?" and 0 means no and 1 means yes. By the same reasoning, $$X_{2}$$ represents whether someone is tall or not. For short people, $$X_{1}$$ and $$X_{2}$$ are both 0 because they are *not* medium and *not* tall. 

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch7_Extending_8"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch7_Extending_8" width="100%" height="820"></iframe>

For the people in the medium group, $$X_{1}$$ should be 1 (because they are in the medium group), and $$X_{2}$$ should be 0 (because they are *not* in the tall group). So the model will give them a predicted thumb length of 56.07 + 4.15 which is equal to 60.22 mm. 

And notice from favstats that the average thumb length of the medium group is 60.22! 

<pre><code>  Height3Group   min    Q1 median    Q3   max     <span style="color: blue">mean</span>      sd  n missing
1        short 39.00 51.00     55 58.42 79.00 <span style="color: blue">56.07113</span> 7.499937 53       0
2       medium 45.00 55.00     60 64.00 86.36 <span style="color: blue">60.22375</span> 8.490406 52       0
3         tall 44.45 59.75     64 68.25 90.00 <span style="color: blue">64.09365</span> 8.388113 52       0
</code></pre>

Dummy coding takes categorical variables and turns them into a series of binary codes. As you can see from the table below, just giving each person a 0 or 1 on $$X_{1}$$ and $$X_{2}$$ can uniquely categorize them as short, medium, or tall.

</style>
<table class="table--outlined">

            <th>Category (Group)</th>
            <th>$$X_1$$ Code</th>
            <th>$$X_2$$ Code</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Short</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Medium</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Tall</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

You may wonder why you need to go through all the details of how R assigns dummy codes for the categorical explanatory variable. It’s important because it gives you a very concrete understanding of how to interpret the model parameters. In this course, we don’t often ask you to calculate numbers on your own. Instead, we want you to focus on thinking about what, exactly, a number means. This will help you do that.

#### Examining the Three-Group Model Fit

You have already done the following: created the ```Height3Group``` categorical explanatory variable; examined the mean thumb lengths of students in each of the three groups; fit the ```Height3Group``` model using ```lm()``` and interpreted the model parameter estimates; and learned how to represent the three-group model using notation of the GLM. 

The final step is to take a look at the ANOVA table so you can compare the fit of the ```Height3Group``` model to the empty model. Of course, you know how to do this using ```supernova()```. Go ahead and get the ANOVA table for the ```Height3Group``` model. 

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch7-22" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-7/ch7-22.html" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p>

Here’s the ANOVA table for the ```Height3Group``` model. Just for comparison, we pasted in the table for the ```Height2Group``` model right above it.

In more advanced classes you will learn how to compare these two models directly. But for our class, we will only compare each model to the empty model.
