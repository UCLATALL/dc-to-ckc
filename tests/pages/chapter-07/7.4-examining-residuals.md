## 7.4 Examining Residuals From the Model

As we have said before, when we use a model to make predictions, our predictions are usually wrong. The residuals, or the distance of each observed score from the predicted score, give us an indication of how wrong our predictions are for each person. 

### Calculating Residuals From the Model

We calculated residuals from the empty model by subtracting the mean from each score. We use the same approach for the more complex model. 

Using the model, we assign a predicted score to each observation. This time, however, the predicted score is not the Grand Mean for everyone, but one mean for females and another for males.

Notice that we use the same strategy to quantify the leftover error from any model. We can do the subtractions in R, just as we did for the empty model. We start with the **TinyFingers** data frame looking like this.  

```
     Sex Thumb Sex.predicted
1 female    56            59
2 female    60            59
3 female    61            59
4   male    63            65
5   male    64            65
6   male    68            65
```

We then calculate the residual for each person by this subtraction: their observed score minus their score predicted by the model. We will save the result in a new variable in **TinyFingers** that we will call **Sex.resid**. 

```
TinyFingers$Sex.resid <- TinyFingers$Thumb - TinyFingers$Sex.predicted
TinyFingers
``` 

```
     Sex Thumb Sex.predicted Sex.resid
1 female    56            59        -3
2 female    60            59         1
3 female    61            59         2
4   male    63            65        -2
5   male    64            65        -1
6   male    68            65         3
```

Another, slightly easier, way to do the same thing is to use the ```resid()`` function, using the **TinySex.model** as the argument. Let’s try that, and save the results in a new variable, **Sex.resid2**. Then let’s print the updated version of **TinyFingers**.

```
TinyFingers$Sex.resid2 <- resid(TinySex.model)
TinyFingers
``` 

```
     Sex Thumb Sex.predicted Sex.resid Sex.resid2
1 female    56            59        -3         -3
2 female    60            59         1          1
3 female    61            59         2          2
4   male    63            65        -2         -2
5   male    64            65        -1         -1
6   male    68            65         3          3
```

Compare the two variables—**Sex.resid** and **Sex.resid2**—in the output. Notice that we get the same values for **Sex.resid2** as we did for **Sex.resid**.

Finally, let’s compare the residuals from the **TinySex.model** to those from the **TinyEmpty.model**. Let’s first add a variable called **Empty.pred** using the ```predict()``` function, and print out **TinyFingers** again. (We could have called the variable anything; the point is to name it something meaningful—so in this case we called it **Empty.pred**, short for predicted from the empty model.)

```
TinyFingers$Empty.pred <- predict(TinyEmpty.model)
TinyFingers
``` 

```
     Sex Thumb Sex.predicted Sex.resid Sex.resid2 Empty.pred
1 female    56            59        -3         -3         62
2 female    60            59         1          1         62
3 female    61            59         2          2         62
4   male    63            65        -2         -2         62
5   male    64            65        -1         -1         62
6   male    68            65         3          3         62
```

Now use the ```resid()``` function to create a new variable in the **TinyFingers** data frame, **Empty.resid**. And print out the updated version of **TinyFingers**.

```
     Sex Thumb Sex.predicted Sex.resid Sex.resid2 Empty.pred Empty.resid
1 female    56            59        -3         -3         62          -6
2 female    60            59         1          1         62          -2
3 female    61            59         2          2         62          -1
4   male    63            65        -2         -2         62           1
5   male    64            65        -1         -1         62           2
6   male    68            65         3          3         62           6

### Graphing Residuals From the Model

You might wonder, why are we bothering to generate and save residuals? We will have a lot more to say about this later. But the short answer is: it helps us to understand the error around our model, and often suggests ways of improving the model. 

Just as the first thing we do when looking at a data set is to examine the distributions of the variables, it is good to get in the habit of examining the distributions of residuals after we fit a new model. 

Let’s go back to the full **Fingers** data frame. We fit the model ```lm(Thumb ~ Sex, data = Fingers)``` and saved the model in **Sex.model**. Using the ```resid()``` function, write some code to generate a new column in **Fingers** called **Sex.resid** (the residuals from the **Sex.model**). 

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch7-7" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-7/ch7-7.html" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p>

In the following window, we have provided the code to create density histograms of **Thumb** in a facet grid by **Sex**. Try modifying it to generate density histograms of **Sex.resid** in a facet grid by **Sex**. Compare the histograms of residuals from the **Sex.model** with histograms of thumb length.  

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch7-8" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-7/ch7-8.html" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p>

In the activity below, we’ve depicted the density histograms of **Thumb** by **Sex** (in black) next to the histograms of **Sex.resid** by **Sex** (in skyblue). 

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch7_Examining_7" src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch7_Examining_7" width="100%" height="480"></iframe>

We can add the means of **Thumb** for females and males to the **Thumb** histograms with some R code. First, we calculate the mean **Thumb** length for each **Sex** group and save it in an R object called **Thumb.stats**:

```
Thumb.stats <- favstats(Thumb ~ Sex, data = Fingers)
```

Then we chain on (```%>%```) a vertical line on our histogram with this code.

```
gf_vline(xintercept=~mean, data=Thumb.stats)
```

Here we have provided the code to add mean lines for each **Sex** group to the **Thumb** histograms. Modify the next chunk of code to add mean lines for each **Sex** group to the **Sex.resid** histograms.
