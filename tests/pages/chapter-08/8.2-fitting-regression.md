## 8.2 Fitting a Regression Model

### Using ```lm()``` to Fit the Height Model to TinyFingers

Now you can begin to see the power you’ve been granted by the General Linear Model fitting—or estimating the parameters—of the regression model, is accomplished the same way as estimating the parameters of the grouping model. It’s all done using the ```lm()``` function in R.

The ```lm()``` function is smart enough to know that if the explanatory variable is quantitative, the model to estimate is the regression model. If the explanatory variable is categorical (e.g., defined as a factor in R), ```lm()``` will fit a group model. 

Modify the code below to fit the regression model using **Height** as the explanatory variable to predict **Thumb** length in the **TinyFingers** data.

```
Call:
lm(formula = Thumb ~ Height, data = TinyFingers)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)       Height  
    -3.1611       0.9848
```

### Fitting a Regression Model By Accident When You Don’t Want One 

Although R is pretty smart about knowing which model to fit, it won’t always do the right thing. If you code the grouping variable with the character strings "short" and “tall,” R will make the right decision because it knows the variable must be categorical. But if you code a grouping variable as 1 and 2, and you forget to make it a factor, R may get confused and fit the model as though the explanatory variable is quantitative. 

For example, we’ve added a new variable to our **TinyFingers** data called **GroupNum**. Here is what the data look like. 

```
  Thumb Height Height2Group GroupNum
1    56     62        Short        1
2    60     66        Short        1
3    61     67         Tall        2
4    63     63        Short        1
5    64     68         Tall        2
6    68     71         Tall        2
```

If you take a look at the variables **Height2Group** and **GroupNum**, they have the same information. Students 1, 2, and 4 are in one group and students 3, 5, and 6 are in another group. If we fit a model with **Height2Group** (and called it the **Height2Group.model**) or **GroupNum** (and called it the **GroupNum.model**), we would expect the same estimates. Let’s try it. 

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch8-2" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-8/ch8-2" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p> 

```
Call:
lm(formula = Thumb ~ Height2Group, data = TinyFingers)

Coefficients:
       (Intercept)  Height2GroupTall  
            59.667             4.667
```

```

Call:
lm(formula = Thumb ~ GroupNum, data = TinyFingers)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)     GroupNum  
     55.000        4.667
```

Because **Height2Group** is a factor (i.e., a categorical variable), ```lm()``` fits a group model. But for **GroupNum**, ```lm()``` thinks the 1 or 2 coding refers to a quantitative variable because we did not tell R that it was a factor. So it fits a regression line instead of a group model. If it does that, the meaning of the estimates will not be what you expect for the group model. 

The slope will be accurate, because it will tell you the increment in thumb length between people coded as 2 versus those coded as 1. But the $$b_{0}$$ estimate will be the y-intercept—that is, the predicted thumb length when $$X_{i}$$ equals 0. This makes no sense when there are only two groups and they are coded 1 and 2. This is an accidental regression model.

Try it here by recoding **GroupNum** as 0 and 1. See if the results fit your expectations.

### Fitting the Height Model to the Full Fingers Data Set

Now that you have looked in detail at the tiny set of data, fit the height model to the full **Fingers** data frame, and save the model in an R object called **Height.model**.  

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch8-3" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-8/ch8-3" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p> 

```
Call:
lm(formula = Thumb ~ Height, data = Fingers)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)       Height  
    -3.3295       0.9619
```

Here is the code to make a scatter plot to show the relationship between **Height** (on the x-axis) and **Thumb** (on the y-axis) for **TinyFingers**. Note that the code also overlays the best-fitting regression line on the scatter plot. Edit the code to make this scatter plot for the full **Fingers** data set.
