## 12.1 What You have Learned about Modeling Variation

At first, this was all we could do. You could spot a relationship in a graph, but you weren’t able to quantify it. But now you can do so much more! You can actually specify and fit models to the data, and figure out how strong the relationship is!

Below we’ve re-drawn the graphs to include the best-fitting regression line. (You totally could have done this yourself; feel free to go back and try it if you want.)

The slope of the right distribution is steeper than the slope of the left distribution." /></p>

Use the code window below to find the best-fitting estimates of these two models.

Call:
lm(formula = avg_hatecrimes_per_100k_fbi ~ share_unemp_seas, data = hate_crimes)

Coefficients:
     (Intercept)  share_unemp_seas  
            1.77             11.99

Call:

Just from our visualizations, we got the impression that the median household income would explain more of the variation in hate crimes than would unemployment. But median household income has a very small slope: .00006, compared to 11.99 for unemployment.

You know by now that to get these statistics, you will need to examine the ANOVA tables for the two models. How did you ever get along without the ```supernova()``` function before? Use the code window below (where we have fit two models for you: **unemp.model** and **income.model**) to get the ANOVA tables for the two models.

From the two models we fit here, we would say that the income model explains more variation in hate crimes than does the unemployment model. States with higher household incomes seem to report more hate crimes to the FBI. This relationship isn’t perfectly predictive, but it does explain 10% of the total error around the empty model.
