## 6.3 Standard Deviation

The *standard deviation* (written as $$s$$) is simply the square root of the variance. We generally prefer thinking about error in terms of standard deviation because it yields a number that makes sense using the original scale of measurement. So, for example, if you were modeling weight in pounds, variance would express the error in squared pounds (not something we are used to thinking about), whereas standard deviation would express the error in pounds.

Here are two formulas that represent the standard deviation:

$$s = \sqrt{s^2}$$

$$\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i-\bar{Y})^2}{n-1}}$$

To calculate standard deviation in R, we use ```sd()```. Here is how to calculate the standard deviation of our **Thumb** data from **TinyFingers**.

```
sd(TinyFingers$Thumb)
```

```
[1] 4.049691
```

There are actually a few different ways you can get the standard deviation for a variable. One is the function ```sd()```, obviously. But you can also square root the variance with a combination of the functions ```sqrt()``` and ```var()```. Yet another, and possibly more useful, way is to use good old ```favstats()```. Try all three of these methods to calculate the standard deviation of **Thumb** from the larger **Fingers** data frame.

### Sum of Squares, Variance, and Standard Deviation

We have discussed three ways of quantifying error around our model. All start with residuals, but they aggregate those residuals in different ways to summarize total error.

All of them are minimized at the mean, and so all are useful when the mean is the model for a quantitative variable.

### Thinking About Quantifying Error in MindsetMatters

Below is a histogram of amount of weight lost (**PoundsLost**) by each of the 75 housekeepers in the **MindsetMatters** data frame.  

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7PKFs57K/svj0tw4.png" width=80% alt="A histogram of the distribution of PoundsLost in MindsetMatters with a vertical line showing the mean." /></p>

Use R to create an empty model of **PoundsLost**. Call it **Empty.model**. Then find the SS, variance, and standard deviation around this model.

There are multiple ways to compute these in R, but here is one set of possible outputs.

### Notation for Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation

Finally, we also use different symbols to represent the variance and standard deviation of a sample, on one hand, and the population (or DGP), on the other. Sample statistics are also called *estimates* because they are our best estimates of the DGP parameters. We have summarized these symbols in the table below (pronunciations for symbols are in parentheses).

<style>
    table.table--outlined { border: 1px solid black;  border-collapse: collapse; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  }
    table.table--outlined th, table.table--outlined td  { border: 1px solid black; padding: .5em; }
</style>
<table class="table--outlined">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Sample (or estimate)</th>
            <th>DGP (or population</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Mean</td>
            <td>$$\bar{Y}$$ (y bar)</td>
            <td>$$\mu$$ (mu)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Variance</td>
            <td>$$s^2$$ (s squared)</td>
            <td>$$\sigma^2$$ (sigma squared)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Standard Deviation</td>
            <td>$$s$$ (s)</td>
            <td>$$\sigma$$ (sigma)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

Variance is the mean squared error around the empty model. It is an average of the squared deviations from the mean. In tables, it may be shortened to be "mean square" or "MSE". You now know that just means variance. Remember in the output (see below) from the ```supernova()``` function the column headed "MS"? That is, in fact, the variance.

```
supernova(Empty.model)
```
