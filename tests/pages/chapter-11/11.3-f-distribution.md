## 11.3 The F Distribution

So far we've used randomization to create a sampling distribution of F values. However, we could also use bootstrapping and simulation. But these computational methods aren’t the only ways to construct sampling distributions of F. Just as mathematicians have developed probability models for the normal distribution (the z, and more useful t, distributions), mathematicians have also developed a probability distribution that does a good job modeling the sampling distribution of F. It’s called the *F distribution*.

The F distribution is a probability distribution that is often used to model the sampling distribution of F. This theoretical distribution takes into account both model and error degrees of freedom. In the same way that a normal distribution can be used as a smooth idealization of sampling distributions of $$b_1$$s, the F distribution is a smooth mathematical object used to represent sampling distributions of F values.

Just as the shape of the t distribution varies slightly according to the degrees of freedom (n-1), the shape of the F distribution also varies by degrees of freedom. But because F is calculated as the ratio of MS (mean square) for model divided by MS for error, we must specify two different degrees of freedom to get the shape of the F distribution, one for the the model and one for error. The df for MS model is 1 in the supernova table below; the df for MS error is 42.

In the **Smiley Face** experiment, you can see from the ```supernova()``` table above that you have 1 df in the numerator, and 42 in the denominator. Below, on the right, we’ve plotted the theoretical F distribution for an F ratio with 1 and 42 degrees of freedom (on the right). We’ve colored the part of this smooth theoretical distribution greater than our sample F in bluish-green. For comparison, on the left, we’ve put the sampling distribution of F we created with randomization (using ```shuffle()```). 

```
xpf(sampleF, df1=1, df2=42)
```

As you can see, the smooth F distribution does a pretty good job modeling the shape of the randomized sampling distribution we created. And because the F distribution is a mathematically defined probability distribution, R can easily calculate the probability of obtaining a score in any particular region of the curve.

Let’s break down the code we used to get the probability in the F distribution. The function ```xpf()``` is about the F distribution, and more specifically about getting the p-value from the F distribution. The x in front of the function is just there because there is another version of this function called ```pf()``` that does not also print out a picture. We prefer ```xpf()``` so that the plot of this mathematical distribution automatically gets printed as well.

The entire line of code ```xpf(sampleF, df1=1, df2=42)``` asks R to return the probability of getting an F ratio more extreme than our sample F (which was 3.305), **if the empty model were true**. The empty model represents a DGP where any differences between groups were the result of chance. All the Fs that could result from running this empty model DGP is modeled by the F distribution with a df1 = 1 and df2 = 42.  The df1 stands for the model df and df2 stands for error df.

The results of this command show us that the probability of getting an F of 3.305 or greater in a study with 1 and 42 degrees of freedom **if the empty model is true** is .076. This, again, is very close to the probability we got from generating a sampling distribution using randomization (```shuffle```). In fact, whether we use the randomized PRE distribution, randomized F, or probability distribution of F, the probability of getting an estimate as high as the one observed in the **Smiley Face** study was, rounded off, .08 in all three cases.

It’s also worth noting that the .076 we got using the F probability calculator is *exactly* the same as we get in the **p** column of the ```supernova()``` table. This is not an accident. The function ```supernova()``` uses the F distribution to calculate **the probability of getting the F value we calculated from the data, or one more extreme, if the empty model were true**.

### Exploring the F Distribution

The shape of the F distribution can change quite markedly as the degrees of freedom in the numerator and denominator of the F ratio change. Here are just two examples, produced using variants of this R code:

```
curve(df(x, df1=1, df2=42), from=0, to=6)
```

```
curve(df(x, df1=6, df2=42), from=0, to=6)
```

A curve of the F distribution for an F ratio with 6 and 42 degrees of freedom on the right. Both distributions are right skewed. The right distribution is clustered more around 1 compared to the left distribution." /></p>

We know from using the ```xpf()``` function introduced previously, that the probability of getting an F of 3.305 if the empty model is true, would be .076. Modify the code in the code window below to determine what the probability would be if our complex model used six degrees of freedom.

The area of Fs that is greater than sampleF is 0.009 and filled in blue. The rest of the area is 0.991 and filled in red."/></p>

You can see that the probability of getting an F of 3.305 or higher in a study with more groups (more model degrees of freedom), but the same number of error degrees of freedom (42), would be much lower (assuming that the empty model were true). 

You can take a look at these F distributions as the df model increases. They were all generated with the same df2. We only changed the df1 (the number of additional parameters in our complex model). Try to describe the pattern you observe.

All 3 distributions are right skewed. The larger the df1, the more clustered around 1 the distribution is."/></p>

The point we want to make is this: the F distribution has a bunch of subtly different shapes based on the df model (df1) and df error (df2). But all F distributions generated from the empty model have a mean of 1. You don’t need to know exactly how the F distributions vary with df1 and df2 (for now). We mostly want to equip you with a tool—you can always run ```xpf()``` to see a picture!
