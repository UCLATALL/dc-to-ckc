## 4.3 More Ways to Visualize Relationships: Point and Jitter Plots

We have learned how to make visualizations of outcome variables as a function of explanatory variables (e.g., histograms and bar graphs in a facet grid). We will learn a few more visualizations in this section.

A scatterplot is a common way to show the relationship between an outcome variable and an explanatory variable. A scatterplot will show each data point as a dot on a graph. A scatterplot in **ggformula** can be made with the function ```gf_point()```. Let’s try using ```gf_point()``` to examine **Thumb** lengths by **Sex**.

```
gf_point(Thumb ~ Sex, data = Fingers)
```

The explanatory variable is on the x-axis, and the outcome variable is on the y-axis. Each point represents an observational unit’s values." /></p>

You can change the color of the points with the argument ```color``` (much like we did before) and the size of the points with ```size```.

```
gf_point(Thumb ~ Sex, data = Fingers, color = "orange", size = 5)
```

The problem with these ```gf_point()``` plots is that you can’t tell when a point is on top of another point. We can jitter these points around a little so that you can see all the individual points better. We’ll use the function ```gf_jitter()``` to create a jitter plot depicting **Thumb** length by **Sex**. This function is just like making a ```gf_point()``` plot, except that the points will be a little jittered both vertically and horizontally.

```
gf_jitter(Thumb ~ Sex, data = Fingers)
``` 

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FRQWz4Sd/Wjj3pjr.png" width=80%  alt="A jitter plot of the distribution of Thumb by Sex in Fingers. Points are jittered both horizontally and vertically to avoid overlapping." /></p>

We can play with a few arguments to modify the jitter plot. As always, we can use the argument ```color```. We can also use the argument ```height``` to change how the points get jittered vertically (i.e., a little bit up or down). In this situation, we might want the vertical jitter (```height```) to be set to 0 so that a point at 60 mm really is a person who has a thumb length of 60. 

```
gf_jitter(Thumb ~ Sex, data = Fingers, color = "orange", height = 0)
``` 

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gJqM6TyM/4s7XNpx.png" width=80% alt="A jitter plot of the distribution of Thumb by Sex in Fingers with customized color and without vertical jitter of the points." /></p>

We can use ```width``` to change how the points get jittered horizontally (i.e., a little bit left or right). Height and width can be set to values between 0 and 1.

```
gf_jitter(Thumb ~ Sex, data = Fingers, color = "orange", width = .1, height = 0)
```

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/NFsd8kpQ/zFHKvn5.png" width=80% alt="A jitter plot of the distribution of Thumb by Sex in Fingers with customized color and horizontal jitter and without vertical jitter of the points." /></p>

If a point is in the **Female** column, it’s a female’s thumb length. But being more to the left or right *within* the female column doesn’t mean anything. The jitter is there just so the points do not overlap too much and obscure how many females have that thumb length.

In a jitter plot, a dense row of points shows that there are a lot of people with that thumb length. For instance, look at all the **Female** points at 60 mm. More points means more people with that particular thumb length.

Just like a scatterplot, in a jitter plot you can change the size of the points by including the argument ```size```. You can also change the transparency of the points using the argument ```alpha```. ```alpha``` can take values from 0 (more transparent) to 1 (more opaque). 

```
gf_jitter(Thumb ~ Sex, data = Fingers, color = "orange", 
   size = 5, alpha = .2, width = .05, height = 0)
```

Less transparent (more opaque) areas indicate a higher frequency of data points." /></p>

Try making jitter plots for a few of the variables from the **Fingers** data frame. Play around with some of the arguments such as ```height```, ```width```, ```color```, ```size```, and ```alpha```. Try making a jitter plot one way, then switching which variable is on the x-axis and which on the y-axis. Does it work both ways?

There isn’t any restriction on what kind of variable you can put in the x- or y-axis. You can put an outcome or explanatory variable in either position. You can also put a categorical or quantitative variable in either position. For example, in this jitter plot, we have put **Sex** on the y-axis and **Thumb** length on the x-axis.

```
gf_jitter(Sex ~ Thumb, data = Fingers, color = "orange")
```

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/y6jQ128x/t4HuHbi.png" width=80% alt="A jitter plot of the distribution of Sex by Thumb in Fingers with customized color of the points. Thumb appears on the x-axis, and Sex is on the y-axis." /></p>

Even though you can put the outcome variable anywhere, it is more common to put the outcome variable on the y-axis. We will follow that convention in our jitter plots because it conforms with what people expect, and thus makes them easier to interpret.
