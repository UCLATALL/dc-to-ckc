## 4.8 From Categorical to Quantitative Explanatory Variables

Okay, let’s go back to where we were, explaining the variation in thumb length using the variable **Sex**. 

<p style="text-align: center;">***THUMB LENGTH = SEX + OTHER STUFF***</p>

Let’s look at the histograms and scatterplots of this word equation, which showed that the overall variation in **Thumb** length could be partially explained by taking **Sex** into account. 

```
gf_dhistogram( ~ Thumb, data = Fingers, fill = "orange") %>%
gf_facet_grid(Sex ~ .)
gf_point(Thumb ~ Sex, data = Fingers, color = "orange", size = 5, alpha = .5)
```

Let’s now see if we can take the same approach for a different explanatory variable: **Height**. First, let’s write a word equation to represent the relationship we want to explore:
 
<p style="text-align: center;">***THUMB LENGTH = HEIGHT + OTHER STUFF***</p>

We might expect that people who are taller have longer thumbs.

We actually could use the same approach with **Height** as we did with **Sex**. But notice, whereas **Sex** is a categorical variable, **Height** is continuous. We can construct a new *categorical* variable by cutting up **Height** into two categories—short and tall. You can do that using the function ```ntile()```. 

Recall that quartiles could be created by sorting a quantitative variable in order and then dividing the observations into four groups of equal sizes. In the same way, we could create tertiles (three equal-sized groups), quantiles (five groups), deciles (10 groups), and so on. The ```ntile()``` function lets you divide observations into any (n) number of groups (-tiles).

Running the code below will divide the students into two equal groups: those taller than the middle student, and those shorter. Students who belong to the shorter group will get a 1 and those in the taller group will get a 2.

```
ntile(Fingers$Height, 2)
``` 

```
  [1] 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1
 [38] 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
 [75] 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 1
[112] 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 2
[149] 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 2
```

Like everything else in R, if you don’t save it to a data frame, this work will go to waste. Use ```ntile()``` to create the shorter and taller group but this time, save this in **Fingers** as a new variable called **Height2Group**. 

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch4-21" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-4/ch4-21" width="100%" height="315" ></iframe></p> 

```
  Height Height2Group
1   70.5            2
2   64.8            1
3   64.0            1
4   70.0            2
5   68.0            2
6   68.0            2
```

Now we can try looking at the data the same way as we did for **Sex**, which also had two levels.  

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch4_Quantitative_3_v2"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch4_Quantitative_3_v2" width="100%" height="450"></iframe> 

Create histograms in a grid to look at variability in **Thumb** based on **Height2Group**. 

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch4-22" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-4/ch4-22" width="100%" height="315" ></iframe></p> 

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/43Rbb1xj/dFeerWo.png" width=100% alt="A faceted histogram of the distribution of Thumb by Height2Group in Fingers. The groups are labeled 1 and 2." /></p>

Is there a difference between groups 1 and 2? Does the taller group have longer thumbs than the shorter group? It would be more helpful if instead of groups 1 and 2, these visualizations were labeled "short" and "tall".

The variable **Height2Group** is categorical because the numbers are stand-ins for categories. In this case, the number 1 stands for "short". This differs from quantitative variables for which the numbers actually stand for quantities. For instance, in the variable **Thumb**, 60 stands for 60 mm.

Before, we learned to use the ```factor()``` function to turn a numeric variable into a factor: ```factor(Fingers$Height2Group)```. We can use the same function to label the levels of a categorical variable. 

```
factor(Fingers$Height2Group, levels = c(1,2), labels = c("short", "tall"))
```

This looks complicated. But you can think of the input to the ```factor()``` function as having three parts (what we call arguments): the variable name, the levels, and the labels.

As always, if we want this change to stick around, we have to save this back into a variable. Use the `<-` (assignment operator that looks like *an arrow*) to save the result of the `factor()` function back into `Fingers$Height2Group`.

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/5t55PFHy/pJRIYRv.png" width=80% alt="A faceted histogram of the distribution of Thumb by Height2Group in Fingers. Group 1 is now labeled short and group 2 is now labeled tall." /></p> 

To get a different perspective on the same data, let’s also try looking at these distributions with a scatterplot and boxplot. 

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch4-14" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-4/ch4-14" width="100%" height="315" ></iframe></p>  

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/NMg6ZfT4/bx3vVlU.png" width=80% alt="Scatterplot and boxplots of Thumb Length by height groups Short and Tall" /></p>

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch4_Quantitative_4"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch4_Quantitative_4" width="100%" height="170"></iframe>

Similar to what we found for **Sex**, where there was a lot of variability within the female group and male group, there is a lot of variability within the short and tall groups. But there is less variability within each group than there would be in the overall distribution we would get if we just combined both groups together. Again, it is useful to think about this within-group variation as the *leftover variation* after explaining some of the variation with **Height2Group**.

See if you can break **Height** into three categories (let’s call it **Height3Group**) and then compare the distribution of height across all three categories with a scatterplot. Create boxplots as well. 

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch4-15" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-4/ch4-15" width="100%" height="315" ></iframe></p> 

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sXwYzd4R/cZeUtBk.png" width=80% alt="Scatterplot of Thumb Length by height groupings Short, Medium and Tall" /></p> 

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Y001qndL/s6fCXzr.png" width=80% alt="Boxplots of Thumb Length by height groupings Short, Medium and Tall" /></p> 

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0j476Y4W/QGgM5Ts.png" width=100% alt="Side-by-side boxplots of Thumb length by two height groupings versus three height groupings" /></p> 

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch4_Quantitative_5"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch4_Quantitative_5" width="100%" height="450"></iframe>

Looking at these two boxplots, we have an intuition that the three-group version of **Height** explains more variation in thumb length than does the two-group version. Although there is still a lot of variation within each group in the three-group version, the within-group variation appears smaller in the three-group than in the two-group model. Or, to put it another way, there is less variation left over after taking out the variation due to height.
