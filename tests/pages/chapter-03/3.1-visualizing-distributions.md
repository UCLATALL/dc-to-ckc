## 3.1 Visualizing Distributions With Histograms

Statistics provides us with a host of tools we can use for exploring distributions. Many of these tools are visual—e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots, bar graphs, and so on. Being skilled at using these tools to look at distributions is an important part of the statistician’s toolbox—something you can take with you from this course!

Let’s start by looking at the distributions of some variables. Histograms are one of the most powerful tools we have for examining distributions.

The x-axis of a histogram represents values of the outcome variable. In the examples above we see (clockwise from upper left): the age of a sample of housekeepers measured in years; the  thumb length of a sample of students measured in millimeters; the life expectancy of the citizens of countries measured in years; and the population of countries measured in millions. 

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch3_Concept_3"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch3_Concept_3" width="100%" height="460"></iframe>

One important thing to note about a histogram is that the y-axis represents either the *frequency* of some score or range of scores in a sample, or the *proportion* of a sample that had some score. So, in the first histogram (in the color coral), the height of the bars does *not* represent how old a housekeeper is, but instead represents the number of housekeepers in this sample who were within a certain age band.

There are lots of ways to make histograms in R. We will use the package 	```ggformula``` to make our visualizations. ```ggformula``` is a weird name, but that’s what the authors of this package called it. Because of that, many of the ```ggformula``` commands are going to start with ```gf_```; the ```g``` stands for the **gg** part and the ```f``` stands for the **formula** part. We will start by making a histogram with the ```gf_histogram()``` command. 

Here is how to make a basic histogram of **Thumb** length from the **Fingers** data frame.

```
gf_histogram(~ Thumb, data = Fingers)
```

Try running it in R.

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Vs2SCk6V/FjnlSbE.png" width=80% alt="A histogram of the distribution of Thumb in Fingers. Thumb lengths are on the x-axis, and the count is on the y-axis." /></p>

Notice that the outcome variable **Thumb** is placed after the ~ (tilde). Typically in R, whenever you put something before the ~, its values go on the y-axis and whenever you put something after the ~, its values go on the x-axis. A histogram is a special case where the y-axis is just a count related to the variable on the x-axis, not a different variable.

Even though this is not very important to statistics, it is fun to change the colors of your histogram. This is pretty easy to do. We can color the outline of the bars by adding in the option  ```color``` and putting in the name of the color in quotation marks–e.g. "red", “black”, “pink” etc. <a href="https://github.com/UCLATALL/czi-stats-course-files/raw/master/Rcolor.pdf" target="_blank">Here is a list of color terms available to you.</a>  

```
gf_histogram( ~ Thumb, data = Fingers, color = "green")
``` 

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/CLDRHpnL/ExmW98f.png" width=80% alt="A histogram of the distribution of thumb lengths in Fingers. The outline of the bars is green. " /></p>

You can also fill in the bars with different colors using the option ```fill```. Note, in R these options (e.g., ```color =``` or ```fill =```) are called arguments because they are added into the function through the parentheses (). 

```
gf_histogram( ~ Thumb, data = Fingers, color = "green", fill = "yellow")
``` 

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Bn0Xm725/YQWQi7F.png" width=80% alt="A histogram of the distribution of thumb lengths in Fingers. The bars are yellow, and the outline of the bars is green." /></p>

We can improve the histograms further by adding labels. For example, we can add a title. To do this we need to chain together multiple R functions: ```gf_histogram()``` and ```gf_labs()``` (which is the function that adds the labels). In R, we use the marker ```%>%``` at the end of a line to chain on a second command. Here’s the code that would add a title to a histogram.

```
gf_histogram(~ Thumb, data = Fingers) %>%
gf_labs(title = "Distribution of Student Thumb Lengths")
``` 

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sg41qPJk/AOSiM4N.png" width=80% alt="A histogram of the distribution of thumb lengths in Fingers. A title “Distribution of Student Thumb Lengths” is added on the top of the histogram." /></p>

Sometimes you may want to change the labels for the axes as well. For example, we might want to label the x-axis "Thumb Length (mm)" instead of just "Thumb". (If you don’t specify a label, R just puts in the variable name, which is **Thumb**.) Here’s the R code for changing the label on the x-axis.

```
gf_histogram(~ Thumb, data = Fingers) %>%
gf_labs(title = "Distribution of Student Thumb Lengths", x = "Thumb Length (mm)")
```

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/q7BgTtbz/u1LCgVS.png" width=80% alt='A histogram of the distribution of thumb lengths in Fingers. A title “Distribution of Student Thumb Lengths” is added on the top of the histogram. X-axis is labeled as “Thumb Length(mm)".' /></p>

Now change the label for the y-axis (to whatever makes sense to you) by modifying the following code. 

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch3-2" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-3/ch3-2" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p>

Whenever you run across an R exercise, feel free to play around with these different options regarding color, fill, or labels. Make R work for you. 

Because the variable on the x-axis is often measured on a continuous scale, the bars in the histograms usually represent a range of values, called *bins*. We’ll illustrate this idea of bins by creating a simple outcome variable called **outcome**. We’ll put it in a tiny data frame called **tinydata**. 

Read the code below that we used to create the data frame. Then, add some code to create a histogram of **outcome**. Try using the arguments **color** and **fill**. Feel free to pick any two colors you want. 

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch3-3" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-3/ch3-3.html" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p> 

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/jj82dsmv/4kXEtes.png" width=80% alt="A histogram of the distribution of outcome in tinydata with large gaps between the bars." /></p>

This histogram shows gaps between the bars because by default  ```gf_histogram()``` sets up 30 bins, even though we only have five possible numbers in our variable. If we change the number of bins to 5, then we’ll get rid of the gaps between the bars. Like this:

```
gf_histogram(~ outcome, data = tinydata, fill = "aquamarine", color = "gray", bins = 5)
``` 

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/G2H24W1R/DJK6dW1.png" width=80% alt="A histogram of the distribution of outcome in tinydata. The bins are right next to each other without gaps." /></p> 

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch3_Concept_10"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch3_Concept_10" width="100%" height="550"></iframe>

Try running the following code.  

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch3-4" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-3/ch3-4.html" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p> 

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/V6pNnKYC/b87gXmy.png" width=80% alt="A histogram of the distribution of outcome in tinydata after we add a new number, 3.2, to our variable. The new number goes into bin 3, which goes from 2.5 to 3.5." /></p>

If you look closely at the x-axis, you’ll see that the bin for 3 actually goes from 2.5 to 3.5.  

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch3_Concept_5"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch3_Concept_5" width="100%" height="440"></iframe>

Add the number 3.7 to our outcome values. Run the code to see what the histogram would look like then. 

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch3-5" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-3/ch3-5.html" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p> 

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nrmhkqzw/g2ShFBR.png" width=80% alt="A histogram of the distribution of outcome in tinydata after we add a new number, 3.7, to our variable. The new number goes into bin 4, which goes from 3.5 to 4.5." /></p>

The 3.7 was added to the 4th bin, which seems to go from 3.5 to 4.5.

You can also adjust the **binwidth**, or how big the bin is. We can add in **binwidth** (like **bins**) as an argument. Here’s an example:

```
gf_histogram( ~ outcome, data = tinydata, fill = "aquamarine", color = "gray", binwidth = 4)
``` 

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/dQZ3wcBm/Wi0dbQb.png" width=80% alt="A histogram of the distribution of outcome in tinydata after we adjust the binwidth. Now we have two bins instead of five. The first bin ranges from -2 to 2, and the second bin ranges from 2 to 6." /></p> 

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch3_Concept_6"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch3_Concept_6" width="100%" height="460"></iframe>

There are two columns because each bin has a width of 4. The first bin goes from -2 to 2 and there are only two numbers that go in that bin from our tiny set of outcomes. All the other numbers go in the bin from 2 to 6.

You may have been surprised to see the x-axis go from -2 to +6. After all, none of our numbers were negative. R did this because we put it in a difficult position. It had to include numbers as high as 5, and we required it to have a binwidth of 4. Not all of the numbers could fit within a single bin of width 4, so R had to make two bins. R just does its best to follow your commands!

We can use ```arrange()``` to sort our outcome values to take a closer look at them.

```
arrange(tinydata, outcome)
```

```
  outcome
1     1.0
2     2.0
3     3.0
4     3.2
5     3.7
6     4.0
7     5.0
```

It is important to note that adjusting the number and width of bins will often change the pattern you see in a variable. So, it’s good to experiment with different settings. 

Modify the code below to generate histograms of **Thumb** with different numbers of bins and bin widths.  

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch3-6" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-3/ch3-6.html" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p>

### Histograms and Density Plots 

*Relative frequency histograms* represent proportion instead of frequency of cases on the y-axis. So, in the histogram of our **tinydata** numbers above, instead of showing two numbers in the bin from -2 to 2, and five in the bin from 2 to 6, it would show .286 of numbers (or 2 out of 7) in the first bin, and .714 (or 5 out of 7) in the second bin. 

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch3_Concept_8_v2"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch3_Concept_8_v2" width="100%" height="700"></iframe>

Relative frequency histograms are useful because they allow you to more easily compare distributions across samples of different sizes. In R, it is easier to use a measure called *density* instead of proportion, and density works better for continuous variables. It’s not exactly the same as a proportion, but it’s close enough. It will still range from 0.0 to 1.0, and the interpretation is similar.

To create density histograms instead of frequency histograms, use a slightly modified function, ```gf_dhistogram()```, such as in the code window below. Run the code below to create a density histogram of the **Age** variable from **MindsetMatters**. Then add the code to produce a basic frequency histogram of the same variable.  

<p><iframe data-type="datacamp" id="ch3-7" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" src="https://uclatall.github.io/czi-stats-course/data-camp/chapter-3/ch3-7.html" width="100%" height="350" ></iframe></p>

Note that you may get a warning when you run these histograms. We got this:

```
Warning message: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin)
```

Don’t worry about it. It’s because there was a missing data point in this data frame. 

<iframe data-type="learnosity" id="Ch3_Concept_9"  src="https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/Ch3_Concept_9" width="100%" height="780"></iframe>

As you can see, the shapes of the two histograms look identical. This makes sense, because the same data points are being plotted with the same bins. The only thing different is the scale of measurement on the y-axis. On the left it is density (think proportion of housekeepers); on the right, frequency (or number of housekeepers).

Notice that in this case the density histogram looks basically the same as the frequency histogram. Density will become more important to us as we start to compare multiple groups, so it’s good to get in the habit of making density plots now.
